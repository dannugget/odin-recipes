        <p> <strong> Ingredients: </strong> </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> 1 pound spaghetti</li> 
            <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed </li>
            <li> 8 slices bacon, diced </li>
            <li> 1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li> 1 clove garlic, minced </li>
            <li> ¼ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li> 4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li> ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li> salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong> Steps to prepare: </strong></p>
        <ol> 
            <p> <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li></p>
            <p> <li> Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li> </p>
            <p> <li> Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li></p>
            <p> <li> Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li></p>
            <p> <li> Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li></p>
        </ol>
